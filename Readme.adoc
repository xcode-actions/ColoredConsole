= Colored Console

This project reenables colors in Xcode`'s console (with a limited palette). Just like this:

== Installation

1. Add the font file named link:Docs/ColoredConsole-Bold.ttf[`ColoredConsole-Bold.ttf`] in the repo via the Mac OS application https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_Book[Font Book].
2. Back to Xcode. Go to "`Preference`" â‡¢ "`Texts & Colors`" â‡¢ "`Executable console Output,`" click the font icon below, then set font to "`Colored Console Bold.`"

== How it works

It`'s been nearly 3 years since the issue "`link:https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors/issues/88[Xcode 8 kills code colors]`" was raised on the venerable https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors[XcodeColors] project. Since then we`'ve been limited to using emojis to add color to our console.

Recently I wondered, has the answer been staring us in the face all that time. While Xcode doesn`'t allow styled text, it does respect colored glyphes such as ðŸ˜Š. That very ticket makes a bunch of suggestions for using them in the console.

`ColoredConsole-Bold` is a font, based on http://mozilla.github.io/Fira/[FiraMono-Bold] which adds ligatures for enabling colored variants of the ASCII character set. Here`'s the default color range:

The 5 colors are enabled by suffixing the character with one of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variation_Selectors_(Unicode_block)[Variation Selectors] 6-10 (`FE06`, `FE07`, `FE08`, `FE09` and `FE0A`).

== Changing the colors

You can have different colors and modifier codepoints by changing and running `./colorify.pl`.  I have not documented this (yet).
